Dataset
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files
CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data

The run_analysis.R scrip shows the process of preparing the dataset as a tidy 
dataset for further analysis, which also indicates the variables and summaries 
calculated, along with units. The following steps is to follow to generate the 
same tidy dataset.
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
